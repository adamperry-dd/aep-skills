# Voice & Tone Guidelines

## Brand voice attributes

DoorDash's brand voice is defined by five core attributes that humanize the brand and inspire communications:

### BOLD
We challenge clichés. Our stories are vibrant and highlight the unexpected.

### OPTIMISTIC
We find joy in face-to-face interactions. Those everyday moments fuel our smiles — and our bright outlook on the future.

### RELENTLESS
We communicate with passion and grit. It's what keeps our stories fresh, never stale.

### THOUGHTFUL
We choose our words carefully, and we speak with honesty and heart.

### HUMBLE
We celebrate the successes of the people we serve. It's not about us, it's about you.

## Overall tone

We aim to strike a tone that's **simple, relatable, and sincere**.

### More like conversations
Communications should feel like conversations — the kind of easy banter that skips the formality and gets right to the good stuff.

- Speak like you're talking to someone you know and care about
- Be relaxed and informal, but not overly chummy or provocative
- Avoid jargon and strive to keep things short
- Everything should sound like a real person saying it, not like a robot

## Tone variations by audience

### To Customers

**We are optimistic**: Speak to the possibilities customers will have to spend more time doing what they love.

**We are thoughtful**: Consider the realities of people's busy schedules, celebrate their wins and laugh about the hiccups in between.

**We are bold**: Elevate unexpected moments beyond the food, whether it's the parents who do it all, the students up all night or the friend who wants to please everyone.

**Do:**
- Speak to the aspirational side of food delivery — delicious flavors, spending time with family and friends, experiencing new cuisine in the comfort of your home
- Reference real-life moments where DoorDash gives you more time in your day
- Find clever ways to amuse customers with spot-on idioms, subtle cultural nods, or light-hearted references

**Don't:**
- Speak to the laziness associated with food delivery — not wanting to get out of pajamas, hungover and hungry, too tired to cook, late-night munchies
- Put too much emphasis on the actual meal or the moment the meal arrives
- Use clichéd puns or one-line jokes

### To Merchants

**We are relentless**: Highlight the way we radically transform their business model and what this means for their top line.

**We are thoughtful**: Speak to their needs and clearly communicate how our unique services can help them increase their reach and revenue.

**We are humble**: Position ourselves as their partner in championing their business initiatives. We're there to celebrate their successes, not ours.

**Do:**
- Speak to them as business owners. Be direct about the impact DoorDash has on their top line and provide tangible examples
- Recognize their passion for food and the reasons they wanted to own a restaurant
- Reinforce our commitment to their success, not ours

**Don't:**
- Over-promise or over-generalize success. Be specific about how DoorDash adds to their business
- Get cute with merchant communications. Recognize that they are busy and don't waste their time on excessively aspirational language

### To Dashers

**We are relentless**: Speak to their ambitions and honor their drive.

**We are optimistic**: Highlight the possibilities that come from added flexibility, extra income, and being part of a larger community.

**We are humble**: Celebrate their successes, not our own.

**Do:**
- Celebrate successes that DoorDash enables with specific anecdotes featuring real people
- Speak to the differentiated benefits of working for DoorDash

**Don't:**
- Dwell on personal struggles or be overt about specific financial situations
- Call out competitors or other brands by name when describing the DoorDash experience
- Call them "our Dashers"
