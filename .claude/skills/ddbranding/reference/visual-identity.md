# Visual Identity Guidelines

## Logo and Monogram

DoorDash's logo and monogram are the most important brand elements and should be used consistently across all materials.

### Logo Versions

**Three primary versions:**
1. **Stacked Logo** - Icon above "DOORDASH" wordmark
2. **Horizontal Logo** - Icon beside "DOORDASH" wordmark
3. **Monogram** - Icon only

The horizontal and vertical versions provide flexibility across a variety of layouts.

### Logo Color Usage

**Critical Rule:** The DoorDash logo should ONLY be used in **Delivery Red** or **white**.

- Never apply colors outside of DoorDash brand colors to the logo
- Logo should be Delivery Red or white only

### Clear Space

Maintain adequate clear space from other graphic elements at all times to preserve logo integrity.

**Horizontal Logo and Monogram:**
- Clear space defined at all sizes by the size of the icon in the logo
- Minimum x distance on all sides
- 0.3x spacing between icon and wordmark

**Stacked Logo:**
- Clear space defined at all sizes by the y-height of the DoorDash wordmark
- Minimum y distance on all sides

### Minimum Size

Logos should never be hard to read or recognize. Minimum sizes for print and digital ensure legibility in all placements.

**Print:**
- Stacked Logo: 1" wide
- Horizontal Logo: 1" wide
- Monogram: .27" wide

**Digital:**
- Stacked Logo: 120 px wide
- Horizontal Logo: 120 px wide
- Monogram: 36 px wide

### Optical Alignment

Because the logo and icon are asymmetrical, they need to be adjusted slightly to appear optically centered and aligned in compositions.

**Centering the Icon:**
1. Center the icon horizontally and vertically using the program's alignment tool
2. Bump the icon 2 px to the left so that the icon is optically centered

**Aligning the Logo:**
1. Left-align the logo with an object or with typography
2. Nudge the logo slightly to the left to optically align the objects

## Logo Don'ts

The DoorDash logo should appear consistently across all communications. The following examples illustrate how it should NOT be used:

1. **Do not apply a color outside of DoorDash brand colors to the logo.** Logo should be Delivery Red or white.

2. **Do not substitute DoorDash's typeface for another.**

3. **Do not warp, stretch, or change proportions of the logo.**

4. **Do not place logo inside a container device.**

5. **Do not rotate or change the angle of the logo.**

6. **Do not rearrange or move elements within the logo.**

7. **Do not add a stroke or outline the logo.**

8. **Do not add effects or treatments to the logo.**

9. **Do not place the logo on a backdrop with low contrast.**
