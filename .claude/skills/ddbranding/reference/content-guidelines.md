# Content Guidelines

## Words We Use, Words We Don't

In order to reinforce our positioning, we must be intentional with the words and phrases we use consistently.

### Preferred Terminology

**People** not users

**Dash** not delivery

**Opportunity** not job

**Community** not local economy

**Fulfill your potential** not fill your wallet

**Better experience** not lower price

**Technology company** not logistics platform

## The Finer Points

Everything you need to know to draft consistent communications across channel and audience.

### Capitalization Rules

**Don't say "our" when speaking to Dashers or Merchants**
- Avoid possessive language that suggests ownership
- Example: Say "Dashers" not "our Dashers"

**Capitalize Dasher when speaking to or about a person**
- "Meet Sarah, a Dasher in Austin" ✓
- "She's been a dasher for two years" ✗

**Lowercase dash when used as a verb**
- "dash to the store" ✓
- "Dash to the store" ✗ (unless starting a sentence)

**Capitalize both Ds in brand name — DoorDash**
- "DoorDash" ✓
- "Doordash" ✗
- "Door Dash" ✗

### Writing Style

**Use contractions wherever applicable**
- "We're here to help" ✓
- "We are here to help" ✗ (too formal)
- "You'll love this feature" ✓
- "You will love this feature" ✗ (too stiff)

**Avoid excessive exclamation points**
- In general, try not to use them at all
- Let the words convey enthusiasm, not punctuation
- Exception: In very specific promotional contexts where energy is appropriate

### Legal Considerations

**Consult the Legal Team for additional guidance on approved words and phrases regarding Dashers.**

Some terminology may have legal implications, particularly when discussing:
- The relationship between DoorDash and Dashers
- Work arrangements and classification
- Earnings and compensation

## Formatting Best Practices

### Sentence Structure

- Use active voice over passive voice
- Front-load important information

### Paragraph Structure

- Keep paragraphs brief (3-4 sentences maximum)
- Use white space to improve readability
- Break up long blocks of text with subheadings

### Lists and Bullets

- Use bullets for unordered information
- Use numbers for sequential steps or ranked items
- Keep list items parallel in structure
- Capitalize the first word of each list item

## Writing for Different Mediums

### Email

- Use clear, specific subject lines
- Put the most important information first

### Website Copy

### Marketing Materials

## Accessibility Considerations

### Alt Text for Images

- Describe images concisely for screen readers
- Include relevant context but avoid redundancy
- Don't start with "Image of..." or "Picture of..."

### Link Text

- Use descriptive link text (not "click here")
- Make links self-explanatory out of context
- Example: "View our merchant guidelines" not "Click here for guidelines"

### Headings

- Use hierarchical heading structure (H1, H2, H3)
- Make headings descriptive and meaningful
- Don't skip heading levels

## Inclusive Language

- Use gender-neutral language by default
- Avoid assumptions about ability, age, or background
- Be specific rather than using broad generalizations
- When in doubt, ask how people prefer to be described
