# Messaging Framework

## The Big Idea: Delivering Good

**Elevator Pitch (High Level)**

At DoorDash, we're not just connecting you with meals, we're connecting you to endless possibilities — easier evenings, happier days, bigger savings accounts, wider nets and stronger communities.

**The Big Idea:** DoorDash: Delivering Good

### Using "Delivering Good" as a Sign-Off

**Do:**
- Use this line as a sign off in advertising (i.e. next to or near logo)
- Use this line when showcasing the good DoorDash is doing in the community (community service, help during a crisis, etc.)

**Don't:**
- Use it as a main headline without the proper context (i.e. showing Dasher at your door with a smile)

### Using "Delivering Good ___" as a Headline

**Do:**
Speak in broader terms, focusing on the positive moments beyond the food.

Examples:
- Delivering good times
- Delivering good vibes
- Delivering good days
- Delivering good date nights

**Don't:**
Speak specifically about food or promotions with this line. It will cheapen the meaning.

Avoid:
- Delivering good food
- Delivering good wings
- Delivering good deals

## How We Talk About DoorDash

## Brand Stewardship

Five big-picture things to keep in mind when staying true to our story:

### 1. Focus on the ends, not the means
Always highlight the smallest moments of joy, success and fun beyond the food — the real-life stuff that everyone can relate to but isn't always celebrated. The rare date night for new parents, a new stove for merchants, or a Dasher saving up to buy his daughter a soccer uniform.

### 2. Let people tell your story
There is nothing more powerful or convincing than hearing from real people about the good things DoorDash does and enables. If you have testimonials, use them.

### 3. Don't brag about the platform, champion the good it creates
Be vocal about the good that DoorDash does and find opportunities to uplift people, places, and communities.

### 4. Find unique ways to contextualize time
For our customers, time back is the emotional reward of using DoorDash. As a brand, we should find unique ways to highlight all the ways customers can use their time to do what they love.

### 5. Always reinforce the essence of our brand: potential
Everything we communicate should ladder back up to the drive to succeed and achieve that unites us and brings people to DoorDash.

## Messaging Examples
