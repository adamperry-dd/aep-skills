# Co-Marketing & Partnerships Guidelines

## Overview

When partnering with other brands, DoorDash has specific guidelines for co-branded materials to maintain brand integrity while respecting partner brands.

**Important:** Please refer to Figma Asset Templates for design templates. Assets shown in brand guidelines are for reference only.

## Partnership Logo Lockups

Partnership logo lockups must feel optically aligned and balanced. The order of logos depends on who is leading the initiative.

### Key Design Elements

**Brand Colors:**
- Always use the respective brand colors for each logo
- When background colors are too bright or contrast poorly with partner logo colors, the entire lockup can be used in white

**Spacing:**
- Keep equidistant spacing between logos and separator
- Maintain optical balance across the lockup

## Horizontal Partner Lockups

### DoorDash-Led Initiatives

When DoorDash leads the partnership initiative, the DoorDash logo should always come first (with some exceptions - see Visual Approach section in full guidelines).

**Horizontal Logo Lockup Structure:**
```
[DoorDash Logo] | [Separator] | [Partner Logo]
```

**Spacing:**
- Use X distance units for equidistant spacing
- X = size of the icon in the DoorDash logo
- Equal spacing on both sides of the separator

**Stacked Logo Lockup Structure:**
```
[DoorDash Logo]
[Separator]
[Partner Logo]
```

**Spacing:**
- Use X distance units for vertical spacing
- Maintain equal spacing above and below separator

### Partner-Led Initiatives

When the partner leads the initiative, the partner logo should come first (with some exceptions - see Visual Approach section).

**Horizontal Logo Lockup Structure:**
```
[Partner Logo] | [Separator] | [DoorDash Logo]
```

**Stacked Logo Lockup Structure:**
```
[Partner Logo]
[Separator]
[DoorDash Logo]
```

**Same spacing rules apply** - maintain optical balance and equidistant spacing.

## Vertical Partner Lockups

### DoorDash-Led Initiatives

**Clear Space Requirements:**

To maintain the integrity of each logo, ensure a minimum clear space from other graphic elements at all times.

**Horizontal Logo and Monogram:**
- Clear space defined at all sizes by the size of the icon in the logo
- Minimum X distance on all sides

**Stacked Logo:**
- Clear space defined at all sizes by the y-height of the DoorDash wordmark
- Minimum X distance on all sides

**Stacked Logo Lockup:**
```
[DoorDash Stacked Logo]
    [Separator - centered]
    [Partner Logo - centered below]
```

**Horizontal Logo Lockup:**
```
[DoorDash Horizontal Logo]
    [Separator - centered]
    [Partner Logo - centered below]
```

### Partner-Led Initiatives

Same structure but partner logo appears first:

**Stacked Logo Lockup:**
```
[Partner Logo - centered]
    [Separator - centered]
    [DoorDash Stacked Logo]
```

**Horizontal Logo Lockup:**
```
[Partner Logo - centered]
    [Separator - centered]
    [DoorDash Horizontal Logo]
```

## Logo Lockup Rules Summary

### Do:
- Always use respective brand colors for each logo
- Maintain equidistant spacing between logos and separator
- Ensure optical alignment and balance
- Use white for entire lockup when background colors cause poor contrast
- Follow clear space requirements
- Place DoorDash logo first in DoorDash-led initiatives
- Place partner logo first in partner-led initiatives

### Don't:
- Mix incompatible logo colors
- Use unequal spacing
- Ignore clear space requirements
- Place logos at different optical weights
- Reverse logo order without proper justification

## Co-Marketing Best Practices

1. **Maintain Brand Integrity**: Both DoorDash and partner logos should be clearly visible and recognizable

2. **Consistent Application**: Use the same lockup style throughout a campaign or partnership materials

3. **Respect Partner Guidelines**: Follow partner brand guidelines as well as DoorDash guidelines

4. **Get Approval**: Co-marketing materials typically require approval from both brand teams

5. **Use Templates**: Leverage Figma Asset Templates when available for faster, compliant design
